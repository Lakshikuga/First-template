				<p class="desc">One of Prince Alwaleed’s lifetime aims is to initiate meaningful dialogue and discussion between Islam and other world cultures to 
				diffuse tensions and to set a path towards openness, understanding, and peace. The Prince has been outraged by the violent actions of an extreme 
				minority that has so hatefully obscured the dignity and peaceful teachings of Islam.</p>

				<p class="desc">He is determined to use his high profile to support peace and to initiate positive change for every citizen of the world. As a 
				member of the Saudi Arabian Royal family, a high-profile international investor and one of the world’s most prominent Muslims, Prince Alwaleed 
				takes his personal responsibilities very seriously.</p>

				<p class="desc">Committed to living a productive life, the Prince has developed a unique personal philosophy to guide him. The Prince is determined 
				to use his high profile to support peace and initiate positive change for every citizen of the world.</p>

				<p class="desc">Prince Alwaleed believes that it is his duty as a good Muslim to use his influence and broad connections to promote understanding 
				and peace between people, and to improve the lives and prospects of those in need, regardless of nationality, race, or creed. As a lifelong student 
				of Islam, he is proud to live his life according to the religion’s five pillars. The Prince spends a great deal of his time reading the holy Qur’an 
				and meditating on its teachings as part of a personal quest to understand the words of the Prophet (PBUH) and correctly interpret this wisdom for 
				the modern world.</p>

				<p class="desc">The Prince describes himself as being a religiously conservative and committed Muslim, but with a liberal outlook on the social 
				and cultural aspects of contemporary Islam. For example, Prince Alwaleed is a keen supporter of women’s empowerment, and is working to improve 
				women’s prospects across the Arab world through his philanthropic activities. Beyond this, Prince Alwaleed is also realistic about the need for 
				economic and social development in Saudi Arabia, and is an advocate of more inclusive societies that have historically been held back by outmoded, 
				autocratic socio-political systems.</p>

				<p class="desc">The Prince is keen to play his part in reducing the economic gap between the world’s social classes, feeling that the basic needs 
				of housing, health care, and education must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
